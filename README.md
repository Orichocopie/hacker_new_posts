## Hacker News Overview

Hacker News, initiated by the startup incubator Y Combinator, functions as a platform where users share stories, referred to as "posts," which undergo voting and comments, much like Reddit. Particularly prevalent within technology and startup communities, Hacker News sees high engagement. Posts reaching the top of Hacker News listings can attract substantial traffic, often garnering hundreds of thousands of visitors.

It is essential to note that the dataset underwent significant reduction (cleaning) from almost 300,000 rows to around 20,000 rows. This reduction involved excluding submissions without any comments and randomly sampling from the remaining submissions.
